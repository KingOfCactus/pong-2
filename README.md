# Pong 2

It started has a little side project that I made in order to learn Rust, but now I decided to use it as my CS50's Final Project. Because of that, interactions with this repository will be blocked until I submit the assigment 👍.

# TO DO
- [ ] Finish both the singleplayer and local multiplayer game modes;
- [ ] Add online with rollback netcode (how hard can this be?);
- [ ] Add a proper README;
- [ ] Submit assigment;
- [ ] Profit (?).
